According to our cancellation terms, documents are requested from our guests in cases of force majeure. As a result of the document evaluation, the guest's advance payment is suspended or the advance payment amount is refunded to the guest. In case of invalid (arbitrary) cancellations of the guest, the advance payment is forfeited, and in cancellation requests with less than 30 days until entry, the remaining payment is also directed to the legal unit to be collected from the guest. The service fee collected by INN ELEGANCE will not be refunded except for force majeure reasons. The service fee will remain with the agency in return for the service it has provided."
